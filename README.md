## Showcase Projects

### Predicting User Churn for Sparkify

- **Description:** This project focuses on building a supervised learning classification model to predict user churn for a music streaming service called Sparkify. By analyzing time-series data, the goal is to identify users likely to cancel their subscription, thereby enabling the service to take preventive measures.
- **Technologies:** Python, Spark Framework (version 2.4.4), Pandas, NumPy, PySpark, Plotly, OS, DateTime, Seaborn.
- **Highlights:** 
  - **Data Exploration and Cleaning:** Loaded and cleaned the dataset, removing rows with no user ID and converting timestamps to a human-readable format.
  - **Feature Engineering:** Created 8 features for the model to improve prediction accuracy.
  - **Modeling:** Compared three models—Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosted Trees (GBM), and Supported Vector Machine (SVM). Selected the RF model after cross-validation and grid search fine-tuning.
  - **Performance:** Achieved an accuracy of about 82% and an F1 score of 78%, showing a 20% improvement over the baseline model.
  - **Scalability:** Designed the code using the Spark Framework to handle larger datasets with ease, allowing for easy refactoring and deployment on clusters.
  - **Improvement Potential:** Highlighted potential improvements by considering more features, domain knowledge, and larger sample sizes for better performance.
